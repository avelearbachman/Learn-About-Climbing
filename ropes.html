  <h3 style="color:#ff784f;">Grading System</h3>
  <p2> In America the grading system is called the Yosemite Decimal System. It always stars with a "5" at the beggining
    which represents the grade of the hike. "1" would be flat and "5" would be a wall that requires gear to climb. This
    grade will range from "5.2" to "5.15".</p2>

  <h3 style="color:#f2ac61;"> Top Rope </h3>
  <p1> In this type of climbing the rope is attached to the top of the wall and then down to your harness with a figure
    eight knot. There's also someone at the bottom doing something called belaying to keep the rope tight and to make
    sure you don't fall.</p1>
  <h3 style="color:#f2ac61;"> Lead </h3>
  <p1> In lead climbing you carry the rope up with you, stopping to clip every three to five feet. However, if you fall
    you can fall about ten feet. This type of climbing is more dangerous than other types of climbing which means that
    you have to be proficient other types before doing this. </p1>
  <h3 style="color:#f2ac61;"> Trad </h3>
  <p1> Trad is a type of climbing that isn't done in a gym, but outside. This is the most dangerous type of ropes
    climbing because you bring up your own gear. Once you put up your protection it isn't tested so it may or not work.
    That's why it's very important to make no mistakes in puting up the gear. Otherwise, the consequences can be
    serious. </p1>
